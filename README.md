###What aspect of implementation did you find easy? 

Inserting and retrieving dataset into the Heroku Mongo database was easy.Here contents of Mongo database was rendered instead of JSON data.

###What aspect of implementation did you find hard?

1.Making multiple AJAX requests was difficult.
Firstly, I tried it using looping to make 100 Ajax style requests.But this created difficulty while clearing the records after 20 records which were displayed on the browser. 
Finally, I tried to run the multiple AJAX by setting 0.5 seconds delay using  the JQuery setInterval method.

2.As in the project 1 , I faced versions problems.

###If you were to use these technologies professionally , what would be your biggest concern?

1.I prefer Ruby on Rails.I One cocnern would be its easy to learn  the language RUBY as a beginner as it has lots of free tutorials to learn and even community to help out with the development.But Rails is both broad and deep, providing a wide range of capabilities. This complexity leads Rails hard to learn for a beginner; it takes many months of development to become familiar with all, or even most, of Rails.

2.It has got thriving community so itâ€™s easy to reach out to someone if you ever need help.

3.Rails encourages developers to test their code.After model or conntroller is generated ,test files are also generated.It also makes easy to add features.
